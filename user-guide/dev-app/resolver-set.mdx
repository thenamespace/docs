## 2. Update/Set Resolver

To make all newly created Offchain Subnames resolvable in all Web3 projects and apps that support ENS resolution, you need to update your parent's name resolver to use Namespace's Hybrid resolver.

Just click the "Update" button, and we'll automatically update your Name's resolver to use ours.
