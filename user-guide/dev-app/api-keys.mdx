---

Easily generate an API key to programmatically manage Offchain subnames in your app, and enable Subname registrations in your project on the [Namespace Dev Portal](https://dev.namespace.ninja).

<Note>
You can only issue 2000 Offchain Subnames to prevent abuse. Reach out on [Telegram](https://t.me/+5FAwyiKOTeswNTIy) to increase your limit. (Free)

## Types of API Keys

There are two types of API keys you can generate:

| Type           | Scope                                             | Use Case                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Address Based** | Works for all ENS names owned by your address    | Use one key for all your domains               |
| **Domain Based**  | Specific to a single ENS domain (e.g., example.eth) | Use different keys for different domains       |

## API Key Expiry

You can set an expiry date for your API keys when generating them. This helps you control access and rotate keys for better security. Expired keys will no longer be valid for API requests.

### Address-based API Key
- Works for all ENS names owned by your wallet address
- Convenient for managing multiple domains with a single key

### Domain-based API Key
- Tied to a specific ENS domain
- Useful for delegating access or using different keys for different domains

<Tip> You can always revoke or regenerate your API keys from the Dev Portal for enhanced security. </Tip>
