Easily generate an API key to programmatically manage Offchain subnames in your app, and enable Subname registrations in your project on the [Namespace Dev Portal](https://dev.namespace.ninja).

<Note>
  You can issue up to **2,000 Offchain Subnames** (to prevent abuse). Contact us on [Telegram](https://t.me/+5FAwyiKOTeswNTIy) if you’d like to raise your limit — it’s free.

## Two Types of API Keys

### 1. Address-based API Key

- Works for all ENS names owned by your wallet address (one key, all domains)
- Convenient for managing multiple domains with a single key

### 2. Domain-based API Key

- Tied to a specific ENS domain like alice.eth (different keys, different domains)
- Useful for delegating access or using different keys for different domains

## API Key Expiry

You can set an expiry date for your API keys when generating them. This helps you control access and rotate keys for better security. Expired keys will no longer be valid for API requests.

<Tip>
  You can always revoke or regenerate your API keys from the Dev Portal for enhanced security.
