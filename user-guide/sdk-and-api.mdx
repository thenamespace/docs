We provide the easiest way to bring **ENS subnames**—onchain or offchain—directly into your app, wallet, rollup, AI-agent, community, or service. Whether you’re a developer building from scratch or a product team shipping at scale, our tools simplify subname integration while keeping everything fully **ENS-compatible** and **production-ready**.

Namespace SDK and API already power wallets, rollups, payment apps, communities, and AI projects across the ecosystem and run hundreds of thousands of subnames. They’re designed to scale from **one** to **millions of subnames**, without tradeoffs between simplicity and control.

## **One toolkit, two ways to build**

1. **Namespace SDK**: A developer toolkit for teams who want to run their own setup and bake ENS logic straight into their stack.

2. **Namespace API**: A hosted service for teams who just want it to work—fast, scalable, no infrastructure required.

Both paths give you the same outcomes: subname creation, resolution, management, and scaling—without reinventing the wheel.

## **Why Use Namespace SDK & API?**

- **Simple Integration** – Get up and running in minutes with clear documentation, prebuilt functions, and support for both onchain and offchain subnames.
- **Scalable & Flexible** – Handle high-volume naming with ease. From gasless offchain subnames to fully onchain integrations, you choose the model that fits your product.
- **Universal Resolution** – Use ENS names or subnames as a universal identity layer across wallets, apps, chains, contracts, and communities.
- **Developer Friendly** – Our SDK (JavaScript/TypeScript) and API are designed to plug directly into your stack and make it easy to build on ENS and Subnames.

## **What you can do with it**

With Namespace, you can:

- **Issue identities at scale** → Give every user, wallet, or agent their own ENS name.
- **Simplify resolution** → Resolve any ENS name/subname instantly.
- **Customize experiences** → Branded subnames for your product, community, or ecosystem.
- **Stay flexible** → Start with offchain subnames (gasless, free to mint) and move onchain or to L2s when it makes sense.
