---

[Namespace App](https://app.namespace.ninja/) â€” **Onchain Subnames (L1 & L2)**.

The Namespace App is the primary interface for discovering, issuing, registering, and managing ENS subnames across L1 and L2 chains. It serves as a no-code, user-friendly hub for communities, brands, DAOs, but also wallets, infra, and tooling service providers, and other apps, to bring human-readable identities to their ecosystems.

## Features Overview

- **[Search Register](./app/search-register)**: Allows users to register ENS names and Subnames directly from our app or a single ENS name page.
- **[Wizard](./app/wizard)**: Allows custom configuration: Name owners can control who can mint subnames through permissioned access, or open issuance to the public with custom settings.
  - **More features include**: Subname selling price customization, Whitelisting, and Token-gating subname minting, Reservations, blacklisting, and custom prices.
- **[ENS Widget](./app/widget)**: Enables Name owners to start minting subnames from their own websites or blogs and increase minting volume.
- **Subname issuance**: Easily issue branded subnames (e.g., user.community.eth) to users, contributors, or community members.
- **Multi-Chain support**: The app supports subname issuance on Ethereum L1, L2s (like OP Mainnet, Base), making ENS accessible to a broader range of platforms and use cases.
- **Onchain records**: Subnames are minted on desired chains (L1 or L2), and Subname records (text, address, content hash) are kept on those chains as well.
- **Best in class UI/UX**: Clean, intuitive interface for minting, managing, and assigning subnames, designed for both technical and non-technical users.
