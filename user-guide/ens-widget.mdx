### **Getting started**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Getting started with ENS Widget">
    To get started, go to [app.namespace.ninja](http://app.namespace.ninja) then head to the **Account** icon.

    <Note>
      This step assumes that you already have an ENS Name. If you don't, you will need to register one on the [Namespace app](https://app.namespace.ninja/) or [ENS app](https://app.ens.domains/).
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate ENS Name">
    To enable Subname registrations through the ENS Widget, you first need to **activate your ENS name(s)**. Once activated, others will be able to mint Subnames from them.

      See the step-by-step guide on how to activate an ENS Name.
    </Card>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Creating the Widget">
    Once you've listed the name(s), you navigate to: Account-\>Widgets and create the Widget from there.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Widget Type">
    Choosing a widget type comes down to the fact of what specifically you want to sell. Currently, there are 4 different types you can choose from:

    1. **All Names** — all available Subnames, from all listed ENS Names on the Namespace platform from every ENS Name owner, will appear in the search and people will be able to mint them from the Widget.
    2. **Owned Names** — all available Subnames, from your listed ENS Names only, will appear in the search and people will be able to mint them from the Widget.
    3. **Selected Names** — all available Subnames, from the ENS Names you listed and selected, will appear in the search and people will be able to mint them from the Widget.
    4. **Single Selected Name** — all available Subnames, from only one ENS Name that you listed and selected, will appear in the search and people will be able to mint them from the Widget.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Selecting Names">
    If you opt for either option 3 or 4 outlined above, you'll be prompted to select the ENS Names you wish to add to the Widget. Only these selected Name(s) will be used for issuing Subnames.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optional ENS Name registration">
    You can optionally allow people to register 2nd-level ENS Names from your Widget as well, by turning ON the "_Allow ENS Name Registrations_" toggle button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch">
    Once you're happy with your setup, you can click update. You'll be prompted to sign the update, and the widget will then be updated with the latest changes and with your wallet completely gaslessly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate into your Website">
    Once you're done customizing and setting up your Widget, you can add it to your website by copying and pasting the Integration Code, and start issuing Subnames directly from there.
