The search extends beyond the simple word search. If the searched word (e.g. `alice.eth`) is unavailable, users are presented with additional options.

Imagine you want to register `alice.eth`. Since it's a fairly common name, it's likely already taken. The ENS app doesn't offer additional options to find a similar name or a subname.

With Namespace, however, if the searched word (e.g. `alice.eth`) is unavailable, users are presented with additional options\!

If you entered "alice" in the Namespace app, it would give you this:

<img
  src="/assets/search-results-for-alice.png"
  alt="Search results for alice"
  width="563"
/>

These options are available Subnames of the search word (`alice.eth`) from the parent Names that had been activated on the Namespace platform to issue Subnames, and have that word - `alice` - available.

This expands the registrar's functionality and opens up a lot of potential integrations. Specifically, projects and dapps that need to expand search and registration functionality, such as Website Builders. This allows their users to immediately find and register a domain name/subname for their newly created website.

On top of that, each subname comes with certain perks and benefits that the ENS Name owner of the parent Name has decided to provide to incentivize minting.

This provides an additional reason for ENS name owners to come up with creative and appropriate incentives for their Names, and start issuing subnames\!

## Registration

Currently, Namespace is the only Dapp that offers **search and registration** of available Subnames from the activated ENS names\! This means that it acts as an aggregate of all ENS names and displays the ones that have available subnames that the user wants to register.

The registration process is familiar and easy to use.

### Registering ENS Name

When registering your ENS Name, you'll be asked:

- Period: The amount of time you wish to register your Name for.
- Price: Amount to be paid for the registration, based on the (sub)name length.
- [Optional] Set the newly registered name as the primary name.

### Registering ENS Subname

When registering your ENS Subname, you'll see the price for the registration. Since the L1 (Ethereum) subnames are, by default, unruggable, the registration length will be inherited from the parent name. L2 Subnames, however, could optionally have a registration period if the parent-name owner wants to rent subnames instead of selling them for a one-time fee.
