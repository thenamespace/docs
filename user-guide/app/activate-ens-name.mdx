# Activate an ENS Name

Activating your ENS Name(s) on the Namespace platforms allows you, and your community or your users, to mint subnames from that name. Subnames can be minted on **Ethereum, Base, or Optimism,** and in the future, we'll support more chains.

## Important to know

<Callout intent="info">
  To mint subnames from 1) Namespace platform, 2) ENS Widget, 3) Farcaster
  frame, or 4) using our SDK, you need to activate that ENS Name first on our
  platform using the Wizard!
</Callout>

## Activating an ENS Name

1. Go to [https://app.namespace.ninja/](https://app.namespace.ninja/).
2. Connect your wallet that has an ENS name you want to activate and issue Subnames from it
   1. In this example, I'll activate `ninjademo.eth`
3. Click on the "Account" icon in the navigation bar (next to Wallet Connect)
4. Click on the "Wizard" tab
5. Click on the "+Activate"

6. Select the Name you want to activate and issue subnames from.
   1. As we said, for us it's ninjademo.eth

## Choose from Two different options

1. Activate the name and issue subnames on Ethereum
2. Activate the name and issue subnames on L2s (Base, Optimism, etc.)
   1. I'll use Base as an example.

## Activate and Mint on L2 chain

Activating an ENS name so that people can mint subnames on L2 chains involves deploying a registry on that L2 chain and other customizations. Let's walk through the entire setup.

1. **Step:** Select "Issue L2 Subnames"

<img src="images/screenshot-2025-06-24-133537.png" alt="Issue L2 Subnames" />

**Setup**:

- Give your listing a name (collection name, could be anything)
- Give your listing a symbol (token symbol, could be anything)
- Decide if you want to retain the ability to take away ownership from someone who mints a subname by having the ability to burn subnames from that collection.
- Choose if you want to 'Rent' them, in which case all prices set up in the next step would apply on a 'per year' basis.

2. **Step**: Define the minting price for Subnames.

<img src="images/screenshot-2025-06-24-133721.png" alt="Define minting price" />

- Base minting price - general price for all subnames
- Price based on length - custom pricing for subnames based on their length
- Special subname price rules for Subnames containing:
  - Numbers-only
  - Letter-only
  - Emoji-only

3. **Step**: Reserve (blacklist) some Subnames from being minted, or making them mintable but for a special price. You can blacklist some swear words, and you can reserve names for your team members, community members, etc.

  alt="Reserve or blacklist subnames"
/>

4. **Step:** Optionally set a Deadline which allows you to control at which date and time in the future the minting will stop.

5. **Step:** Two Whitelisting options you can choose from:

<img src="images/screenshot-2025-06-24-134110.png" alt="Whitelisting options" />

- Only whitelisted wallet addresses will be able to mint a Subname
- Whitelisted wallet addresses can be minted for free and everyone else will have to pay for the prices you had set up in the "Minting Price" customization.

6. **Step:** The last one is Token-gated minting, which allows you to token-gate who gets to mint a Subname from the ENS name you're listing by requiring them to hold:

<img src="images/screenshot-2025-06-24-134200.png" alt="Token-gated minting" />

- A certain amount of some ERC20 token
- Some specific ERC721 tokens (NFTs usually from some collection)

That's all.

Once you're happy with everything, just click on "List Name" and you're good to go. People can now mint subnames from your ENS Name through:

1. Namespace platform ([app.namespace.ninja/"yourENSname.eth"](https://app.namespace.ninja/))
2. Custom-built solution you build yourself (your wallet, game, community page, etc.) [using our SDK](../../../dev-docs/sdk/)
3. [ENS Widget](../ens-widget.md) - you can configure and add to your website/blog and allow people to mint subnames directly from there
4. [Farcaster Frame](../farcaster-frames/) - you can create a Frame through which people will be able to mint subnames
5. [Subpage](https://github.com/thenamespace/subpages) - you can create your own custom-branded Subname minting website with our pre-built template, with subname registrations embedded.
