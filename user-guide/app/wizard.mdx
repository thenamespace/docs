Widget lets you activate any ENS name you own and start issuing subnamesâ€”whether you want to sell them, gift them, rent them out, or use them to build community.

Designed with simplicity and UX in mind, the Wizard makes subname issuance easy for anyone with no technical knowledge required.

We built it to serve a wide range of users:

- **Wallets** issuing usernames to their users
- **Games** assigning in-game identities
- **Payment apps** enabling Venmo-like experience
- **AI agents** needing sovereign, persistent identities
- **L2s** offering onchain naming to their users
- **Tools and infra projects** embedding ENS identity into their stack
- **Communities** looking to reward members
- **DAOs** offering identity to contributors
- **Creators and Bloggers** distributing supporter badges

If you already have an ENS name and an audience, the Wizard helps you turn your name into a utility, giving your people a unique, web3-native identity they can truly own.
