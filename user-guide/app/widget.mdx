## Getting started

To get started, go to [app.namespace.ninja](https://app.namespace.ninja/) then head to Account.

To allow Subname registrations from the Widget, you will need to list your ENS name(s) first, from which you want to allow people to mint Subnames.

For how to list the ENS name, please see the following page:

<Card title="Activate ENS Name" href="./activate-ens-name" icon="toggle-on" arrow="true">
  Learn how to list your ENS name for Subname registrations.
</Card>

Once you've listed the name(s), you navigate to: Account → Widgets and create the Widget from there.

## Creating a new Widget

Once you create a new Widget and give it a name you'll see the following form. This form allows you to further customize what specifically you want to do with your Widget.

## Choosing Widget Type

Choosing a widget type comes down to the fact of what specifically you want to sell. Currently, there are 4 different types you can choose from:

1. **All Names** — all available Subnames, from all listed ENS Names on the Namespace platform from every ENS Name owner, will appear in the search and people will be able to mint them from the Widget.
2. **Owned Names** — all available Subnames, from your listed ENS Names only, will appear in the search and people will be able to mint them from the Widget.
3. **Selected Names** — all available Subnames, from the ENS Names you listed and selected, will appear in the search and people will be able to mint them from the Widget.
4. **Single Selected Name** — all available Subnames, from only one ENS Name that you listed and selected, will appear in the search and people will be able to mint them from the Widget.

## Selecting Names

If you opt for either option 3 or 4 outlined above, you'll be prompted to select the ENS Names you wish to add to the Widget. Only this selected Name(s) will be used for issuing Subnames.

## Optional ENS Registration

You can optionally allow people to register 2nd level ENS Names from your Widget as well by turning on or off the "Allow ENS Name Registrations" toggle button.

## Launch

Once you're happy with your setup, you can click update. You'll be prompted to sign the update, and the widget will then be updated with the latest changes and with your wallet completely gaslessly.

## Integrate into your Website

Once you're done customizing and setting up your Widget, you can add it to your website and issue Subnames directly from there.
