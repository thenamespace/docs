[**Subpage**](https://github.com/thenamespace/subpages/) is a customizable subname minting template that enables ENS name owners (companies, communities, DAOs, and others) to issue subnames from a custom-built website in record time! For example, if an organization owns _awesome.eth_, using a Subpage template, they can quickly spin up a custom website to allow members to mint personalized subnames like _**alice**.awesome.eth_. Itâ€™s designed to help projects, communities, creators, developers, and teams turn their ENS names into brandable namespaces for identity, membership, access, and more.
