# SDK

The Namespace SDK is a TypeScript library built to simplify the integration of ENS Subname registrations into Web3 projects. It provides developers with a simple way to interact with the Namespace’s backend APIs and smart contracts.

The primary intention of the SDK is to streamline the ENS adoption. We do it by simplifying the Subname integration, issuance, and management. Currently, the SDK supports subnames on L2 chains (Base, Optimism, etc.) and Offchain Subnames. Furthermore, it's built to support the Subname-as-a-Service model—ideal for companies looking to offer subname registration as part of their service offering or product stack.

Whether you’re building decentralized apps (wallets, launchpads, payments, etc.), managing digital identities for your DAO, community, or company, or running a high-end blockchain tools and service company, the Namespace SDK offers a powerful solution to leverage the full potential of ENS Subnames in your projects.

SDK consists of several packages:

- [Offchain Manager](./offchain-manager)
- [Indexer Manager](./indexer-manager)
- [Mint Manager](./mint-manager)
