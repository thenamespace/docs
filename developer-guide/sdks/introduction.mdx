# SDK

The Namespace SDK is a TypeScript library designed to simplify ENS Subname registration and management in Web3 projects. It enables seamless interaction with Namespace backend APIs and smart contracts, supporting subnames on L2 chains (Base, Optimism, etc.) and Offchain Subnames. The SDK is ideal for projects offering Subname-as-a-Service or integrating subname features into decentralized apps, DAOs, or blockchain tools.

SDK packages include:
