`@namespacesdk/mint-manager` is a TypeScript library for minting subnames under names activated on the Namespace platform. It abstracts the complexities of interacting with smart contracts, supporting both Ethereum Mainnet and Layer 2 networks like Base and Optimism. The library uses Viem under the hood for seamless integration.
