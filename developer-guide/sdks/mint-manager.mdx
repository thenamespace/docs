# Mint Manager

`@namespacesdk/mint-manager` is a TypeScript library for minting subnames under names that are activated on the Namespace platform.

It enables seamless interaction with the Namespace ecosystem, allowing users to mint both Mainnet and Layer 2 (L2) subnames on supported networks, including Base and Optimism. The SDK abstracts the complexities of interacting with smart contracts, ensuring a smooth developer experience.

The library uses Viem under the hood.

### Features

- **Mint Subnames**: Easily mint ENS subnames activated on the Namespace platform.
- **Mainnet & L2 Support**: Works with Ethereum Mainnet as well as Layer 2 networks like Base and Optimism.
- **Subname Availability Checks**: Determine whether a subname is available for minting.
