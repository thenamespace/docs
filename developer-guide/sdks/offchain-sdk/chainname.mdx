description: "Learn about the ChainName enum and how it maps to the appropriate coin types."

Address records on the ENS side are stored according to the [SLIP-0044](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md) specification.\
This library provides an abstraction over those records by exposing a `ChainName` enum, which internally maps to the appropriate coin types.

**Currently Supported Chains**

```typescript
export enum ChainName {
  Ethereum = "eth",
  Solana = "sol",
  Arbitrum = "arb",
  Optimism = "op",
  Base = "base",
  Polygon = "polygon",
  Bsc = "bsc",
  Avalanche = "avax",
  Gnosis = "gnosis",
  Zksync = "zksync",
  Cosmos = "cosmos",
  Near = "near",
  Linea = "linea",
  Scroll = "scroll",
  Bitcoin = "btc",
  Starknet = "starknet",
  Sui = "sui",
}
```

If the chain you need is not listed above, feel free to reach out to us on [Telegram](https://t.me/+5FAwyiKOTeswNTIy) weâ€™ll be happy to add support as soon as possible. Alternatively, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/thenamespace/namespacesdk/issues) on our GitHub repository.
