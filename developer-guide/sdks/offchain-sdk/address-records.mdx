# AddressRecords

These methods allow you to add, update, or delete blockchain address records associated with a subname.

### 1. addAddressRecord

The `addAddressRecord` method adds or updates an address record for the specified subname on the given blockchain network.

### Usage Example

```typescript
client.addAddressRecord({
  subname: "ns.myensname.eth",
  chain: ChainName.Ethereum,
  value: "0x0123...",
});
```

- `subname`: The full ENS subname (e.g., `"ns.myensname.eth"`).
- `chain`: A value from the `ChainName` enum representing the target blockchain.
- `value`: The address to associate with the subname for the specified chain.

### 2. deleteAddressRecord

The `deleteAddressRecord` method removes an address record for a specific blockchain from a given subname.

- `subname`: The full ENS subname.
- `chain`: The blockchain network whose address record should be removed.

<Hint type="info">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Removing an address record will disassociate the
  blockchain address from the subname but does not affect other records.
</Hint>

### Usage Example

```typescript
client.deleteAddressRecord({
  subname: "ns.myensname.eth",
  chain: ChainName.Ethereum,
});
```
