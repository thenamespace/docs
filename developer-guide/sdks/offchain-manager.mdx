## Offchain Client

An Offchain Manager is a library for interacting with subnames, text records, data records in an ENS-like system. It is built on top of Axios and provides a convenient API for managing off-chain data.

The `createOffchainClient` function sets up an Offchain Client.

import { createOffchainClient } from "@namespacesdk/offchain-manager";

const client = createOffchainClient({
  timeout: 5000,
});
```
