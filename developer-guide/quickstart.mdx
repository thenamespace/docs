## Introduction

Namespace provides Subname infrastructure and developer tools for teams to easily build on top of ENS. Namespace allows you to create and manage ENS subnames both offchain and onchain.

{/* 
Offchain subnames are gasless and instant and are managed via an API or JS SDK.

Onchain subnames are decentralized on either Ethereum Mainnet or any L2 network, but they are not gasless and instant.
*/}

## Start building

Choose your integration path based on your needs.

<Tip>
  Audience: Developers. For a high-level overview and model selection (Offchain vs L2 vs L1), see <a href="/getting-started">Getting started</a>.
