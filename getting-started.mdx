## Introduction

[ENS](https://ens.domains/) turns long 0x addresses into memorable names like `alice.eth`. Subnames extend a parent name (e.g., `brand.eth`) to create usernames for people, apps, and agents — like `alice.brand.eth`.

[Namespace](https://namespace.ninja/) allows builders to easily **implement Subname registrations** in their apps, wallets, chains, AI agents, or communities. Subnames function across wallets, apps, and chains, serving as an identity layer to enhance user experience, safety, and streamline onboarding.

## Choosing where subnames live

There are 3 key ways to issue subnames. Use this guide to pick the right approach for you.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Offchain">
    Offchain subnames are simple database records and work by leveraging [CCIP-read](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668). Best for large-scale issuance, require no gas fees to create, flexible ownership controls, and simple API/SDK management. Great default for most apps.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="L2 chain">
    L2 subnames are minted as NFTs on supported L2s (Base, Optimism for now, but could be deployed on any L2). Lower costs than L1 with stronger decentralization and ownership.

    </Card>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="L1 chain">
    L1 subnames are fully decentralized, unruggable, and 100% under the users' control once minted. Minted on the Ethereum mainnet at a higher cost. Fits premium, low-volume cases.

## Subname Use Cases and Benefits

Discover who is using ENS Subname in Web3 and what for.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="See Subname Use Cases">
    - **L2 chain** → consistent ecosystem naming and discovery with one namespace.
    - **Wallets** → Branded wallet names (human-readable names instead of addresses).
    - **Payment apps** → Simple names for sending/receiving payments.
    - **AI agents** → Each agent gets a sovereign, unique, verifiable ENS ID/profile.
    - **Launchpads** → Auto-assign subnames to every contract or AI agent created.
    - **RaaS providers** → Chain-wide naming service for every rollup.
    - **Blockchain infra/tools** → Adds a universal identity layer for developers.
    - **Wallet-as-a-Service** → One wallet name that works across all chains.
    - **Games** → Custom player usernames with cross-chain utility.
    - **Identity apps/services** → Use ENS as the foundation for digital identity.
    - **Communities** → Subnames for members, strengthening shared identity.
    - **Individuals** → Creators give subnames to followers for onboarding.
    - **All others** → Any user-facing app needs names as identity primitives.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="See Subname Benefits">
    - **Universal identity** → One name works across apps, wallets, and blockchains.
    - **Trust & safety** → Reduces errors, scams, and copy-paste risks.
    - **Scam protection** → No phishing, address spoofing, clipboard hijacking, etc.
    - **Simplified Onboarding** → Users get onboarded simply by registering a username.
    - **New revenue streams** → Premium names, renewals, subname activations.
    - **Referrals** → Domains and subdomains used as trackable referral links.
    - **Portability** → Identity you own, not locked to any app or chain.
    - **Brand Visibility** → People wear their _name_.base.eth as their social handle.
    - **Social identity** → Communities distribute branded names
    - **Cross-app interoperability** → ENS usernames resolve across 1,000\+ web3 apps
    - **Onchain Profile** → ENS \+ metadata (avatar, social handles, website, addresses...)
    - **Immutable websites** → Decentralized, censorship-resistant website (contenthash)
