## What is Namespace

Namespace is the leading infrastructure provider for ENS subnames. With products designed for scale, we make it easy to launch branded subnames both onchain or offchain. Namespace enables wallets, rollups, AI agents, payment apps, and communities to give their users human-readable ._eth_ names as identities—replacing long hexadecimal wallet addresses with simple, recognizable, and universally resolvable names. As the [official ENS Service Provider](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/20404686300257550242704646761273386459664655640264490428281621095220078268383), Namespace is already powering millions of resolutions and hundreds of thousands of active subnames across Web3. We make Web3 identity simple, scalable, and accessible for every builder in the Web3 space.

<Accordion title="What is ENS?">
  The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is the open, decentralized naming protocol that transforms long, unreadable blockchain addresses (e.g., 0xKm3w...Ko17) into simple, human-readable names (e.g., _alice_.eth). Built on Ethereum, ENS serves as a universal identity layer across Web3, resolving to wallet addresses, smart contracts, websites, and metadata, while giving users ownership and control over their names as NFTs. ENS enables safer transactions, easier onboarding, and more consistent digital identities across wallets, dapps, L2s, and services, making it a core piece of Ethereum’s infrastructure and the foundation for decentralized identity on the internet.
</Accordion>

## What are ENS subnames?

ENS turns long 0x addresses into memorable names like `alice.eth`. Subnames extend a parent name (e.g., `brand.eth`) to create usernames for people, apps, and agents — like `alice.brand.eth`. Namespace allows builders to easily **implement Subname registrations** in their apps, products, or communities. Subnames function across wallets and apps, serving as an identity solution to enhance safety and streamline onboarding.

## Choosing where subnames live

There are 3 key ways to issue subnams. Use this guide to pick the right approach for you.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Offchain">
    Offchain subnames are simple database records and work by leveraging [CCIP-read](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668). Best for large-scale issuance, require no gas fees to create, flexible ownership controls, and simple API/SDK management. Great default for most apps.

    </Card>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="L2 chain">
    L2 subnames are minted as NFTs on supported L2s (Base, Optimism for now, but could be deployed on any L2). Lower costs than L1 with stronger decentralization and ownership.

    </Card>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="L1 chain">
    L1 subnames are fully decentralized, unruggable, and 100% under the users' control once minted. Minted on the Ethereum mainnet at a higher cost. Fits premium, low-volume cases.

## Who’s using subnames and why

Discover some of the most common Subname uses in Web3.

<Accordion title="See Subname use cases" defaultOpen iconType="regular">
  - **AI launchpads** → Auto-assign subnames to every new AI agent created.
  - **L2 chain** → consistent ecosystem naming and discovery with one namespace.
  - **Wallets** → Branded wallet names (human-readable names instead of addresses).
  - **Payment apps** → Simple names for sending/receiving payments.
  - **AI agents** → Each agent gets a sovereign, unique, verifiable ENS ID/profile.
  - **Launchpads** → Auto-assign subnames to every contract or AI agent created.
  - **RaaS providers** → Chain-wide naming service for every rollup.
  - **Blockchain infra/tools** → Adds a universal identity layer for developers.
  - **Wallet-as-a-Service** → One wallet name that works across all chains.
  - **Games** → Custom player usernames with cross-chain utility.
  - **Identity apps/services** → Use ENS as the foundation for digital identity.
  - **Communities** → Subnames for members, strengthening shared identity.
  - **Individuals** → Creators give subnames to followers for onboarding.
  - **All others** → Any user-facing app needs names as identity primitives.

## Subname Benefits

Check out some of the benefits Subname implementation brings.

<Accordion title="See Subname Benefits" iconType="regular">
  - 
  - **Universal identity** → One name works across apps, wallets, and blockchains.
  - **Trust & safety** → Reduces errors, scams, and copy-paste risks.
  - **Scam protection** → No phishing, address spoofing, clipboard hijacking, etc.
  - **Simplified Onboarding** → Users get onboarded simply by registering a username.
  - **New revenue streams** → Premium names, renewals, subname activations.
  - **Referrals** → Domains and subdomains used as trackable referral links.
  - **Portability** → Identity you own, not locked to any app or chain.
  - **Brand Visibility** → People wear their _name_.base.eth as their social handle.
  - **Social identity** → Communities distribute branded names
  - **Cross-app interoperability** → ENS usernames resolve across 1,000\+ web3 apps
  - **Onchain Profile** → ENS \+ metadata (avatar, social handles, website, addresses...)
  - **Immutable websites** → Decentralized, censorship-resistant website (contenthash)
