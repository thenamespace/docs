## What are ENS subnames?

ENS turns long 0x addresses into memorable names like `alice.eth`. Subnames extend a parent name (e.g., `brand.eth`) to create usernames for people, apps, and agents — like `alice.brand.eth`.

Subnames work across wallets and apps, can serve as identity solution to improve safety and onboarding.
