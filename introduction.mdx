## What is ENS

<Note>
  To understand Namespace, you have to be familiar with ENS first.
</Note>

The Ethereum Name Service ([ENS](https://app.ens.domains/)) is the open, decentralized naming protocol that transforms long, unreadable blockchain addresses (e.g., 0xKm3w...Ko17) into simple, human-readable names (e.g., _alice_.eth). Built on Ethereum, ENS serves as a universal identity layer across Web3, resolving to wallet addresses, smart contracts, websites, and metadata, while giving users ownership and control over their names as NFTs. ENS enables safer transactions, easier onboarding, and more consistent digital identities across wallets, dapps, L2s, and services, making it a core piece of Ethereum’s infrastructure and the foundation for decentralized identity on the internet. [Learn more](https://docs.ens.domains/learn/protocol).

## What is Namespace

Namespace is the leading infrastructure provider for **ENS subnames**. With products designed for scale, we make it easy to launch branded subnames both **onchain or offchain**. Namespace enables **wallets, rollups, AI agents, payment apps, communities**, and others to give their users human-readable ._eth_ names as identities—replacing long hexadecimal wallet addresses with simple, recognizable, and universally resolvable names. As the [official ENS Service Provider](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/20404686300257550242704646761273386459664655640264490428281621095220078268383), Namespace is already powering millions of resolutions and hundreds of thousands of active subnames across Web3. We make Web3 identity simple, scalable, and accessible for every builder in the Web3 space.

## What are ENS subnames?

ENS turns long 0x addresses into memorable names like `alice.eth` and Subnames extend a parent name (e.g., `brand.eth`) to create usernames for people, apps, and agents — like `alice.brand.eth`. Namespace allows builders to easily **implement Subname registrations** in their apps, products, or communities. Subnames function across wallets and apps, serving as an identity solution to enhance safety and streamline onboarding. [Learn more](user-guide/subpages.mdx).

## ENS is multichain

ENS protocol was built to work across chains and ecosystems. Names/domains are minted on Ethereum, but they resolve in 1,000\+ apps, and support 100\+ chains, and the protocol is extensible by design, so it can support a million more chains.

ENS names have '_address records_' which store addresses from different chains. If you look at the example above (thecap.eth), it has Solana and BTC addresses next to EVM addresses (Eth, Base, Zksync, etc.). So you can send \$BTC to 'thecap.eth' name if the wallet you're using correctly reads/resolves address records from thecap.eth (which most of them do).

Just **One Universal Username**, storing all blockchain addresses the user needs, used as a central point of Web3 Identity for username-to-username payments.

## Vision

Replace all hexadecimal blockchain addresses with human-readable (ENS-powered) names or subnames and streamline ENS implementation across the entire Web3 space.

## Who do we work with?

- **Wallets** → Branded wallet names (human-readable names instead of addresses).
- **L2 chain** → consistent ecosystem naming and discovery with one namespace.
- **Payment apps** → Simple names for sending/receiving payments.
- **AI agents & launchpads** → Auto-assign a subname to every new AI agent created.
- **RaaS providers** → Chain-wide naming service for every rollup.
- **Wallet-as-a-Service** → One wallet name that works across all chains.
- **Blockchain infra/tools** → Adds a universal identity layer for developers.
- **Website builders** → deploy websites to custom immutable subnames.
- **Referral protocols** → custom subdomains as referral tracking links.
- **Games** → Custom player usernames with cross-chain utility.
- **Identity apps/services** → Use ENS as the foundation for digital identity.
- **Communities** → Subnames for members, strengthening shared identity.
- **Individuals** → Creators give subnames to followers for onboarding.
- **All others** → Any user-facing app needs names as identity primitives.

## Traction

- 110,000 subnames minted
- 3M\+ resolution requests served
- 200\+ names activated (registries deployed)
- 120\+ ENS Widgets created
- 30\+ partnerships and integrations done

## Let's work together

We’re partnering with wallets, rollups, AI projects, payment apps, web3 communities, and others to bring ENS-powered identities to their users.

**Let’s build the identity layer of the decentralized internet together.**
