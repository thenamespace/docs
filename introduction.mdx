## What is ENS

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is the open, decentralized naming protocol that transforms long, unreadable blockchain addresses (e.g., 0xKm3w...Ko17) into simple, human-readable names (e.g., _alice_.eth). Built on Ethereum, ENS serves as a universal identity layer across Web3—resolving to wallet addresses, smart contracts, websites, and metadata—while giving users ownership and control over their names as NFTs. ENS enables safer transactions, easier onboarding, and more consistent digital identities across wallets, dapps, L2s, and services, making it a core piece of Ethereum’s infrastructure and the foundation for decentralized identity on the internet.

## What is Namespace

Namespace is the leading infrastructure provider for ENS subnames, helping wallets, rollups, AI agents, payment apps, and communities give their users human-readable ._eth_ identities, replacing hexadecimal wallet addresses. Through its Apps, SDKs, APIs, and white-label tools, Namespace makes it easy to launch branded subnames at scale—whether onchain, offchain, or across L2s—powering millions of resolutions and hundreds of thousands of active subnames. As the official ENS Service Provider, Namespace drives adoption of ENS by making Web3 identity simple, scalable, and accessible for every builder and ecosystem in Web3.
