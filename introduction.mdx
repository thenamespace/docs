## What is ENS

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is the open, decentralized naming protocol that transforms long, unreadable blockchain addresses (e.g., 0xKm3w...Ko17) into simple, human-readable names (e.g., _alice_.eth). Built on Ethereum, ENS serves as a universal identity layer across Web3—resolving to wallet addresses, smart contracts, websites, and metadata—while giving users ownership and control over their names as NFTs. ENS enables safer transactions, easier onboarding, and more consistent digital identities across wallets, dapps, L2s, and services, making it a core piece of Ethereum’s infrastructure and the foundation for decentralized identity on the internet.

## What is Namespace

Namespace is the leading infrastructure provider for ENS subnames, helping wallets, rollups, AI agents, payment apps, and communities give their users human-readable ._eth_ identities, replacing hexadecimal wallet addresses. Through its Apps, SDKs, APIs, and white-label tools, Namespace makes it easy to launch branded subnames at scale—whether onchain, offchain, or across L2s—powering millions of resolutions and hundreds of thousands of active subnames. As the official ENS Service Provider, Namespace drives adoption of ENS by making Web3 identity simple, scalable, and accessible for every builder and ecosystem in Web3.

## Subname Use Cases

  - **AI launchpads** → Auto-assign subnames to every new AI agent created.
  - **Transaction safety** → Reduces risk of mis-sent funds due to copy-paste or phishing.
  - **Wallets** → Branded wallet names (human-readable names instead of addresses).
  - **Payment apps** → Simple names for sending/receiving payments.
  - **AI agents** → Each agent gets a sovereign, unique, verifiable ENS identity and profile.
  - **Launchpads** → Auto-assign subnames to every contract or AI agent created.
  - **RaaS providers** → Chain-wide naming service for every rollup.
  - **Blockchain infra/tools** → Adds a universal identity layer for developers.
  - **Wallet-as-a-Service** → One wallet name that works across all chains.
  - **Games** → Custom player usernames with cross-chain utility.
  - **Identity apps/services** → Use ENS as the foundation for digital identity.
  - **Communities** → Subnames for members, strengthening shared identity.
  - **Individuals** → Creators give subnames to followers for onboarding.
  - **All others** → Any user-facing app needs names as identity primitives.
