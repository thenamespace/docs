## What is ENS

<Note>
  To understand Namespace, you have to be familiar with ENS first.
</Note>

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is the open, decentralized naming protocol that transforms long, unreadable blockchain addresses (e.g., 0xKm3w...Ko17) into simple, human-readable names (e.g., _alice_.eth). Built on Ethereum, ENS serves as a universal identity layer across Web3, resolving to wallet addresses, smart contracts, websites, and metadata, while giving users ownership and control over their names as NFTs. ENS enables safer transactions, easier onboarding, and more consistent digital identities across wallets, dapps, L2s, and services, making it a core piece of Ethereum’s infrastructure and the foundation for decentralized identity on the internet.

## What is Namespace

Namespace is the leading infrastructure provider for ENS subnames. With products designed for scale, we make it easy to launch branded subnames both onchain or offchain. Namespace enables wallets, rollups, AI agents, payment apps, and communities to give their users human-readable ._eth_ names as identities—replacing long hexadecimal wallet addresses with simple, recognizable, and universally resolvable names. As the [official ENS Service Provider](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/20404686300257550242704646761273386459664655640264490428281621095220078268383), Namespace is already powering millions of resolutions and hundreds of thousands of active subnames across Web3. We make Web3 identity simple, scalable, and accessible for every builder in the Web3 space.

## What are ENS subnames?

ENS turns long 0x addresses into memorable names like `alice.eth`. Subnames extend a parent name (e.g., `brand.eth`) to create usernames for people, apps, and agents — like `alice.brand.eth`. Namespace allows builders to easily **implement Subname registrations** in their apps, products, or communities. Subnames function across wallets and apps, serving as an identity solution to enhance safety and streamline onboarding.
