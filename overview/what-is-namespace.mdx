[~~Namespace~~](https://namespace.ninja/)~~ is the official ENS Service Provider focused on Subname services, Dev integrations, and Partnerships for ENS.~~

~~Namespace provides a suite of developer and consumer tools and apps designed to make it easy to edit, mint, and manage ENS subnames or implement subname registrations in any product or app.~~

~~Simply put, Namespace allows all ENS name owners to issue, manage, and sell subnames from their ENS names, effectively making every single ENS name owner a Digital Identity provider running their own namespace.~~

~~By simplifying Digital Identity integration, issuance, and management in the blockchain space, Namespace aims to enhance adoption, reduce the risk of transaction errors, and democratize access to the ENS naming service, ensuring it's easy to use for everyone.~~

~~Recognizing this opportunity, Namespace has built a ~~[~~Platform~~](https://app.namespace.ninja/)~~, ~~[~~Dev Portal~~](https://dev.namespace.ninja/)~~, ~~[~~Namespace SDK~~](developer-guide/sdks)~~, ~~[~~Subpages~~](https://github.com/thenamespace/subpages)~~, and ENS Widget to offer a service that simplifies and streamlines the subname implementation and management.~~
