Namespace lets you create and manage offchain ENS subnames. They are a more flexible and scalable way to issue subnames than the current ENS subname issuance process and the best part is they are gasless and thereby free.

## How to create an offchain subname

1. Go to the [Namespace Dev App](https://dev.namespace.ninja/)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Click on the "Create Subname" button
4. Select the ENS name you want to create a subname for
5. Click on the "Create Subname" button
