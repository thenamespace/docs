## Overview

Use subnames to onboard users with a name (not an address), improve payment safety, and provide cross-app identity.

## Common use cases

- Wallet UX: branded usernames for every wallet
- Payments: safer send/receive with human-readable names
- L2/Platform identity: ecosystem-wide names (e.g., `user.chain.eth`)
- Communities: names for members or holders
- AI agents: verifiable identities for agents and services

## Choose a model

- Offchain: gasless, instant, scalable issuance via API/SDK (default)
- L2: NFT ownership, lower cost than L1, portable across apps
- L1: premium, low-volume scenarios; highest decentralization
