## Overview

Use subnames to onboard users with a name (not an address), improve payment safety, and provide cross-app identity.

## Common use cases \+ benefits

- **Wallets**: branded usernames for every wallet
- **Payments**: safer send/receive with human-readable names
- **L2/Platform identity**: ecosystem-wide names (e.g., `user.chain.eth`)
- **Communities**: names for members or holders
- **AI agents**: unique, verifiable identities for agents and services

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="More Use Cases">
    - **AI launchpads** → Auto-assign subnames to every new AI agent created.
    - **Website builders** → use .eth subnames to deploy free decentralized websites.
    - **Websites** → .eth domains resolve to decentralized, censorship-resistant websites.
    - **RaaS providers** → Chain-wide naming service for every rollup.
    - **Blockchain infra/tools** → Adds a universal identity layer for developers.
    - **Wallet-as-a-Service** → One wallet name that works across all chains.
    - **Games** → Custom player usernames with cross-chain utility.
    - **Identity apps/services** → Use ENS as the foundation for digital identity.
    - **L2 chains** → unified chain-wide identity under one .eth name as a root zone.
    - **Payment apps** → Venmo-like transacting experience in crypto.
    - **Individuals** → Creators give subnames to followers for onboarding.
    - **All others** → Any user-facing app needs names as identity primitives.

    - **Portability** → Identity you own, not locked to any app or chain.
    - **Brand Visibility** → People wear their _name_.base.eth as their social handle.
    - **Social identity** → Communities distribute branded names
    - **Cross-app interoperability** → ENS usernames resolve across 1,000\+ web3 apps
    - **Onchain Profile** → ENS \+ metadata (avatar, social handles, website, addresses...)
    - **Immutable websites** → Decentralized, censorship-resistant website (contenthash)

## Choose a model

- **Offchain**: gasless, instant, scalable issuance via API/SDK (default)
- **L2**: NFT ownership, lower cost than L1, portable across apps
- **L1**: premium, low-volume scenarios; highest decentralization
