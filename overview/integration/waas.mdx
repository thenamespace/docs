## Overview

As a Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS) provider, you can make your product feel simpler and safer by adding ENS subnames. Instead of users dealing with long hexadecimal addresses like `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb`, they see friendly names like `alice.wallet.eth` that work across wallets, apps, and chains.

**Why this matters:**
- **Better UX**: Users send money to `alice.wallet.eth` instead of copying/pasting long addresses
- **Reduced errors**: Human-readable names reduce typos and mistaken transactions
- **Brand recognition**: Every subname carries your brand (e.g., `.wallet.eth`)
- **Universal compatibility**: Works across 1,000+ wallets, countless apps and multiple chains
- **New revenue stream**: Monetize subname creation through tiered developer plans

## Three Integration Paths

Here are three simple ways to add ENS subnames, depending on your goals:

## 1. Template or Starter Kit

**Best for**: Understanding the integration flow and testing the user experience

A simple starter kit that demonstrates how ENS subnames replace hexadecimal wallet addresses in your application. This is the fastest way to experience how subnames work in practice.

### What You Get

A complete, working example showing:
- How users create their own subname during onboarding
- How to replace address displays with human-readable names
- Reverse resolution: show a subname instead of an address (e.g., `alice.wallet.eth` instead of `0x742d...0bEb`)
- The complete flow from creation to resolution

### Technical Approach

We provide ready-to-use starter kits built with popular WaaS providers:

- **[Privy Starter Kit](/developer-guide/integrations/starters/privy-nextjs)** - Next.js app with Privy auth, offchain subnames, and profile flows
- **[Openfort Starter Kit](/developer-guide/integrations/starters/openfort-nextjs)** - Next.js app with Openfort embedded wallets and identity resolution
- **[RainbowKit Starter Kit](/developer-guide/integrations/starters/rainbowkit-nextjs)** - Next.js app with RainbowKit wallet connection and subname management


**This serves as your opening path** to experience the complete subname flow before implementing it in your product.

## 2. Branded Usernames with Your ENS Name

**Best for**: Issuing subnames directly to your users with your brand identity. 

Give every user a Web3 username that carries your brand. When users onboard, they get a subname like `alice.wallet.eth` that's instantly resolvable across all wallets, dapps, and services where your wallet infrastructure is integrated.

Example: Like Uniswap usernames (e.g., `uni.eth`). You can offer your own brand usernames (e.g., `alice.wallet.eth`).

### Business Benefits

- **Brand visibility**: Every subname reinforces your brand (`.wallet.eth` appears everywhere)
- **Improved onboarding**: Users get a memorable name instead of an address during signup
- **Cross-platform identity**: Same username works wherever your service is integrated
- **Monetization opportunity**: Create tiered plans limiting subname creation by developers
- **Future-proof**: Start with offchain (gasless, instant) and migrate to onchain when needed

### User Experience Flow

1. **User signs up** → Gets wallet address `0x742d...0bEb`
2. **During onboarding** → User chooses username `alice`
3. **System creates subname** → `alice.wallet.eth` is issued via API
4. **Username works everywhere** → User can send/receive as `alice.wallet.eth` across all integrated apps


#### Monetization Strategy

You can monetize subname creation by:
- **Free tier**: X subnames per developer/month
- **Pro tier**: Unlimited subnames
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits + support

Control this through your backend—simply track usage and enforce limits before calling the Namespace API.

## 3. Ecosystem or Global Wallets

**Best for**: Allowing developers to bring their own ENS name and issue subnames to their users

Enable developers using your wallet infrastructure to issue subnames with their own ENS name (e.g., `happy.brand.eth` instead of `happy.wallet.eth`). This turns subnames into a service you offer, letting developers customize the identity layer for their applications.

### Business Benefits

- **New product offering**: Subname-as-a-Service becomes a core feature
- **Developer retention**: Unique identity solution keeps developers on your platform
- **Revenue opportunity**: Charge per subname created or through tiered plans
- **Competitive differentiation**: Not all WaaS providers offer branded identities
- **Scalable architecture**: Same backend, multiple developer brands

### Use Case Example

A developer building a payment app:
1. Registers `payments.eth` as their brand name
2. Uses your wallet infrastructure for transactions
3. Issues subnames like `alice.payments.eth` to their users
4. Users send money as `alice.payments.eth` instead of addresses
5. Brand is visible everywhere: `.payments.eth` appears across all integrations

### Same Benefits, Multiple Brands

This approach provides the same benefits as approach #2, but with developer-owned brand names:
- ✅ Better UX (names instead of addresses)
- ✅ Reduced transaction errors
- ✅ Brand visibility (each developer's `.eth` name)
- ✅ Universal compatibility (works everywhere)
- ✅ Revenue opportunity (charge developers for usage)
