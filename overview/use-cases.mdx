### **Wallets**

Replace confusing hexadecimal wallet addresses with branded, human-readable ENS subnames (e.g., _alice._**_wallet_**_.eth_). This improves UX, builds brand loyalty, simplifies the onboarding process, and makes daily transacting safer and more intuitive.

### **L2 Chains** 

Provide a consistent namespace across the entire chain (e.g., base.eth / [Basenames](https://www.base.org/names)). Every user, dapp, and contract can be named and discovered under the same rootzone (.eth name), enabling builders to use it as a chain-specific naming system and enhance identity within the ecosystem.

### **Payment Apps**

Create a Venmo-like user experience in crypto transacting. Let users send and receive payments with simple names instead of long addresses. ENS subnames reduce errors, increase transaction confidence, and make payments as easy as typing a username.

### **AI Agents & Launchpads**

Automatically assign an ENS subname to every new AI agent at the moment of creation. This gives each agent a sovereign, unique, verifiable, human-readable identity from day one, improving discoverability, interoperability, and user trust.

### **RaaS Providers** 

Offer a built-in, chain-wide naming service for every rollup that gets deployed. Branded subnames become the identity layer of the rollup, enhancing UX and enabling frictionless cross-chain username interoperability.

### **Blockchain Infrastructure & Tools** 

Add ENS to your plugin/add-on marketplace and allow your developers to implement it as a naming service inside their apps without having to change environments. Universal and composable identity layer for developers and projects. 

### **Wallet-as-a-Service Providers**

Issue wallet names that work across all chains and networks, allowing WaaS providers to implement subname-as-a-service and add ENS utility to their stack. This can simplify onboarding for partners and deliver consistent identities to end users. 

### **Games**

Assign custom player usernames as ENS subnames, enabling players to carry their gaming identity across ecosystems, wallets, and even outside of the game.

### **Identity Apps & Services** 

Use ENS as the backbone for decentralized identity, linking subnames to verifiable credentials, onchain activity, and social profilesâ€”making identity portable across Web3.

### **Communities, Brands**, Memes

Strengthen belonging by issuing subnames to members (e.g., _username._**pepe**_.eth_). Shared naming fosters identity, culture, and discoverability across platforms.

### **Individuals/Creators** 

Distribute subnames to fans or followers as part of onboarding into their ecosystem.

### All Others

Identity starts with a name. All apps, protocols, or chains need an identity and a naming service.
