## Wallets

Custom-branded wallet names (e.g., `alice.metamask.eth`) replace traditional wallet addresses, allowing users to register and use ENS subnames for their wallets. This improves wallet UX, simplifies onboarding, and enhances transaction safety for users.

### Payment apps

Payment apps integrate ENS subnames to simplify transacting for users by replacing complex wallet addresses with human-readable names, enabling faster, more secure, and user-friendly, and even cross-chain payments.

### AI agents and launchpads

AI agents and launchpads use ENS subnames to create unique, verifiable identities for all AI agents, improving discoverability, interoperability, and user trust while offering a decentralized naming service for AI agents from the launch.

### RaaS (Rollup-as-a-Service) providers

RaaS providers leverage ENS subnames to offer a complementary chain-wide naming service for every rollup. Enabling scalable, branded identities for rollups and enhancing the user experience with human-readable names.

### Blockchain infra, tools, & service providers

Companies that focus on providing developers the best suite of tools to build on any blockchain benefit from having ENS as the best naming service in Web3 to make their offering more complete and appealing to developers.

### Wallet-as-a-Service providers

Wallet-as-a-Service providers use ENS subnames to offer branded, user-friendly wallet names, enabling one wallet name for all chain addresses. Giving subname registration as a service to wallets.

### Games

Games use ENS for custom-branded player usernames (`alice.yourGame.eth`), offering cross-chain functionality and interoperability, unlike siloed, centralized usernames that lack utility beyond their platforms.

### Identity (apps or services)

Identity requires a name and all identity-related apps and services should integrate ENS as a naming service for their clients or users.

### Communities

Communities use subnames to strengthen their collective identity, boost brand reputation, and create a more connected, recognizable presence across Web3.

### Individuals (entrepreneurs, influencers, bloggers)

ENS advocates issue subnames to their community, followers, readers, or anyone else interested in getting a name for their wallet when onboarded to crypto.

### All Others

Identity starts with a name. And all user-centric or AI Agent-centric apps, protocols, or chains need an identity and a naming service.
