~~One of the major challenges in the blockchain industry is the complex and confusing user experience, particularly in transaction processes. Wallets with their public addresses, private keys, seed phrases, and especially long 42-character addresses (e.g. ~~`0x3Kp6…17D3`~~) pose a significant barrier to entry and navigating the space comfortably for the average user. This complexity not only deters adoption and long-term use but has also led to substantial losses due to address input errors among other things.~~

~~The blockchain user base, which is constantly growing, is often intimidated by these complexities. To solve this issue, ENS or ~~[~~Ethereum Naming Service~~](https://ens.domains/)~~ has done a great job and has become an industry leader. ENS maps the long-format Wallet address to the human-readable ~~`.eth`~~names. And so ~~ `0x3Kp6…17D3`~~becomes something like ~~ `alice.eth`~~, or ~~`neywork.eth`~~or ~~ `anon.eth`~~, and so on.~~

~~Similar to what DNS does for IP addresses, ENS does the same for all blockchain-based resources: wallet addresses, contract addresses, token addresses, domains, or any onchain assets. Unlike DNS, however, which only maps IP addresses to human-readable ~~`.com`~~, ~~`.net`~~, ~~`.xyz`~~, etc. domains to resolve websites in browsers, ENS names can be used much more broadly (wallet names, contract names, multichain identifiers, AI agent identity, in-app usernames, decentralized website domains, and many other cases), and as ERC721 or ERC1155 NFTs stay in full control of their owner with no centralized entity over them\!~~

## ~~The Focus~~

~~Where ENS can and should rely on its Ecosystem Service Providers is to expand its face-on value and utility by building products and solutions that streamline its adoption for everyone who wishes to implement a Web3-native naming service powered by ENS protocol. Ease of implementation needs to be given for a range of users, and it should not be expected that they dedicate months of work to implement it.~~

~~Recognizing this opportunity, ~~[~~Namespace~~](https://namespace.ninja)~~ has built a ~~[~~Platform~~](https://app.namespace.ninja/)~~, ~~[~~Dev Portal~~](https://dev.namespace.ninja/)~~, ~~[~~Namespace SDK~~](developer-guide/sdks)~~, ~~[~~Subpages~~](https://github.com/thenamespace/subpages)~~, and ENS Widget to offer a service that simplifies and streamlines the subname implementation and management.~~
