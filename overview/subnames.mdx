[ENS](https://ens.domains/) replaces unreadable 42-byte addresses with human‑readable names. Subnames extend a parent name (e.g., `brand.eth`) to create usernames for people, apps, and agents — like `alice.brand.eth`.

For a concise overview of what subnames are, how to leverage them, how to choose Offchain vs L2 vs L1, and who uses them, see the <a href="/introduction">Getting started</a> page.

## Different Types of Subnames

ENS subnames can live on L1, L2, or offchain. L2 and offchain are similar in UX; the key differences are decentralization, cost, and ownership model.

### L1 Subnames

If you own a .eth name like nick.eth and go to create a subname in the manager app, you will be creating a subname on Ethereum Mainnet (L1) by default. This is the simplest way to create a subname with the least amount of moving pieces, but ultimately you are limited by the gas fees of Ethereum Mainnet.

If you'd like to issue L1 subnames to your users, prefer low-volume, premium cases due to higher gas costs.

### L2 Subnames

Developers can connect an ENS name on L1 with their own smart contracts on any L2 network, and depending on the implementation, this could be fully trustless while significantly reducing the cost of issuing subnames.

### Offchain Subnames

Offchain subnames are exactly what they sound like - subnames that live in a centralized database on private servers, also powered by CCIP Read. If your goal is to name a large amount of EVM addresses quickly and cheaply, with a low barrier to entry, offchain subnames might be for you. Often times, managing offchain names is as simple as interacting with a REST API.
From a user perspective, offchain subnames function similarly to onchain subnames. They won’t appear as NFTs, but resolve the same data (addresses, text records, etc.). With our hybrid resolver, you can issue these at scale and use them across apps.
